#' Run a single hypergeometric test.

#' Run hypergeometric enrichment over the gene ontology
#' 
#' This function implements a Rust version of the gene ontology enrichment with elimination:
#' the starting point are the leaves of the ontology and hypergeometric tests will first conducted there.
#' Should the hypergeometric test p-value be below a certain threshold, the genes of that gene ontology
#' term will be removed from all ancestors.
#' 
#' @param target_genes: A character vector representing the target gene set.
#' @param go_to_genes: A named list with the gene identifers as elements and gene ontology identifiers as 
#' names.
#' @param ancestors: A named list with the go identifiers of all ancestors as elements and the gene ontology
#' identifiers as names.
#' @param levels: A named list with the go identifiers of that ontology level as elements and the level name
#' as names. IMPORTANT! This list needs to be ordered in the right way!
#' @param gene_universe_length: The length of the gene universe.
#' @param min_genes: number of minimum genes for the gene ontology term to be tested.
#' @param elim_threshold: p-value below which the elimination procedure shall be applied to the ancestors.
#' @param debug: boolean that will provide additional console information for debugging purposes.
