## *Description* 

This package contains various bioinformatics and computational biology workflows
that are being routinely used, ranging from gene set enrichment analyses, to 
network-based approaches to module detection in bulk RNAseq. The package tries
to implement bare bone versions of most of the functionalities, leveraging Rust
in any computational bottlenecks to go *brrrrrrr*.
