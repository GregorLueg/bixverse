## *Description* 

This package contains various bioinformatics and computational biology workflows
that are being routinely used, ranging from gene set enrichment analyses, to 
network-based approaches for module detection in bulk RNAseq. The package 
provides useful, bare bone versions of most bioinformatics functionalities and
leverages Rust to make any computational bottlenecks go *brrrrrrr* (i.e., fast).

## *Release notes*

This is now officially the version **0.0.2.2** release. With this 
update the following has been updated/changed:

- ...

## *Installation*

You will need Rust on your system to have the package working. An installation
guide is provided [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). There is a 
bunch of further help written [here](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/index.html)
by the rextendr guys in terms of Rust set up. (bixverse uses rextendr to interface
with Rust.)

Steps for installation: 

1. In the terminal, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
   
2. In R, install [rextendr](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/index.html):

```
install.packages("rextendr")
```

3. Finally install bixverse:

```
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/GregorLueg/bixverse")
```

## *Aim*

Good question, why this package? Basically, there are three reasons for this:
1. Rust makes everything in R so much faster, that we just wished to share the 
joy. Also, it's a fun language write.
2. BioConductor is great, but you end up with quite large dependency graphs, 
lots of packages that have to be downloaded and quite a few algorithms can 
benefit from the speed that Rust offers. The idea of `bixverse` is to accelerate
key functions used in CompBio and bioinformatics and reduce them to the 
barebone methods with simple interfaces.
3. Having worked in biotech and pharma, one realises that a surprising amount
of time is spent on rewriting and reimplementing published methods for internal
usage. Better to make it fast/good once, and open it up to the public via open 
source.
