**THIS IS THE ALPHA VERSION OF THE PACKAGE WHICH IS NOW PUBLIC**

## *Description* 

This package contains various bioinformatics and computational biology workflows
that are being routinely used, ranging from gene set enrichment analyses, to 
network-based approaches for module detection in bulk RNAseq. The package provides
useful, bare bone versions of most bioinformatics functionalities and leverages Rust
to make any computational bottlenecks go *brrrrrrr* (i.e., fast).

## *Installation*

You will need Rust on your system to have the package working. An installation
guide is provided [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
