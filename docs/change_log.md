of target gene sets.
- Implementation of a gene ontology aware hypergeometric test for gene ontology
analysis (using hypergeometric tests under the hood)
- Network diffusion methods based on personalised page-rank (single diffusion
and tied diffusion)
- Community detection algorithms on top of diffusion scores over network.
- Reciprocal best hit graphs using set similarities between different gene modules
from different data sets/methods.
- Contrastive PCA implementation for gene module detection.
- (Differential) Correlation-based methods for gene module detection, using 
network-based detection of graph communities.
- Independent component analysis (with the versions to run stabilised versions)
- Smaller helper function to calculate the Hedge's G effect size or using the
OpenTargets method to summarise scores over different evidences.
