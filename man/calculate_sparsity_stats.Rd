\title{Helper function to calculate the induced sparsity}
\usage{
calculate_sparsity_stats(object, no_exp_bins = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{synthetic_bulk_data} object. You need to have run
\code{\link[=simulate_dropouts]{simulate_dropouts()}} for this function to work.}

\item{no_exp_bins}{Integer. Number of expression bins to check. Defaults to
\code{10L}.}
}
\value{
A list with various statistics about the sparsity
\itemize{
\item original_sparsity - Original proportion of zeroes in the counts.
\item final_sparsity - Sparsity after applying
\code{\link[=simulate_dropouts]{simulate_dropouts()}}.
\item added_sparsity - Added sparsity.
\item gene_sparsity_mean - Mean sparsity for the genes.
\item gene_sparsity_sd - SD sparsity form the genes.
\item sample_sparsity_mean - Mean sparsity for the genes.
\item sample_sparsity_sd - SD sparsity for the genes.
\item dropout_by_expression - Dropout per expression bin level.
