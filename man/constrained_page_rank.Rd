\title{Constrained personalised page rank}
\usage{
constrained_page_rank(
  graph,
  personalisation_vector,
  sink_nodes = NULL,
  sink_edges = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{igraph. This one needs to be directed and weighted and have
the node attribute \code{type} defining the node type and the edge attribute
\code{type} defining the edge type.}

\item{personalisation_vector}{Numerical vector. The personalisation vector
for the reset of the personalised page rank. The function will automatically
normalise it.}

\item{sink_nodes}{Optional String vector. The node types that should force
a reset.}

\item{sink_edges}{Optional String vector. The edge types after which there
should be a forced reset.}
}
\value{
The constrained personalised page rank
}
\description{
This function implements a constrained personalised page-rank. You can define
\code{sink_nodes} or \code{sink_edges}. In the case of the former, the vist of a
sink_node (via a type attribute in the igraph) will automatically cause the
surfer to reset. In the case of the latter, the traversal of a sink_edge is
allowed, however, subsequently, the surfer will be reseted. This function can
be useful for deriving PPR profiles under constraints in heterogenous graphs
and has been inspired by Ruiz, et al.
