\title{Constrained personalised page rank over a list}
\usage{
constrained_page_rank_ls(
  graph,
  personalisation_list,
  sink_nodes = NULL,
  sink_edges = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{igraph. This one needs to be directed and weighted and have
the node attribute \code{type} defining the node type and the edge attribute
\code{type} defining the edge type.}

\item{personalisation_list}{A list of numerical vectors to use for the
personalisation.}

\item{sink_nodes}{Optional String vector. The node types that should force
a reset.}

\item{sink_edges}{Optional String vector. The edge types after which there
should be a forced reset.}
}
\value{
A list with the constrained personalised page rank values.
}
\description{
This function implements a personalised constrained page-rank over a list of
personalisation vectors for the same network. You can define \code{sink_nodes}
or \code{sink_edges}. In the case of the former, the vist of a sink_node (via a
type attribute in the igraph) will automatically cause the surfer to reset.
In the case of the latter, the traversal of a sink_edge is allowed, however,
subsequently, the surfer will be reseted. This function can be useful for
deriving PPR profiles under constraints in heterogenous graphs and has been
inspired by Ruiz, et al.
