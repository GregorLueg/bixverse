\title{Generate an RBH graph.}
\usage{
generate_rbh_graph(
  object,
  minimum_similarity,
  overlap_coefficient = FALSE,
  spearman = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The underlying class, see \code{\link[=rbh_graph]{rbh_graph()}}.}

\item{minimum_similarity}{The minimum similarity to create an edge.}

\item{overlap_coefficient}{Boolean. Shall the overlap coefficient be used
instead of Jaccard similarity. Only relevant if the underlying class is set
to set similarity.}

\item{spearman}{Boolean. Shall Spearman correlation be used. Only relevant
if the underlying class is set to correlation-based similarity.}
}
\value{
The class with added properties.
}
\description{
This function will generate an RBH graph based on set similarity between
gene modules. You have the option to use an overlap coefficient instead of
Jaccard similarity and to specify a minimum similarity.
