\arguments{
\item{object}{The underlying class, see \code{\link[=gene_ontology_data]{gene_ontology_data()}}.}

\item{target_gene_list}{List. The target genes list you wish to apply the
gene set enrichment analysis over.}

\item{minimum_overlap}{Integer. Threshold for the minimal overlap.}

\item{fdr_threshold}{Float. Threshold for maximum fdr to include in the
output.}

\item{elim_threshold}{Float. Threshold from which p-value onwards the
elimination on the ancestors shall be conducted.}

\item{min_genes}{Integer. Minimum number of genes that have to be included in
the gene ontology term. If NULL, it will default to the number of minimum
genes stored in \code{gene_ontology_data}.}

\item{.debug}{Boolean. Shall information from the Rust function be displayed.
For debugging purposes. Warning: should you run this command over a large
list, you will have a large print output!}

data.table with enrichment results.

\description{
This method takes the gene_ontology_data and a list of target gene sets and
performs an GSE enrichment leveraging ontological information. It starts at
the lowest levels of the ontology and tests if there is significant
enrichment for any GO terms. If the threshold of the p-value is below the
elimination threshold, the genes from this term will be removed from all its
ancestors. The function then proceeds to the next level of the ontology and
repeats the process. The class will leverage Rust threading to parallelise
the process.
