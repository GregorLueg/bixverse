\usage{
rs_module_scoring(
  f_path_cells,
  f_path_genes,
  gs_list,
  cells_to_keep,
  nbin,
  ctrl,
  seed,
  streaming,
  verbose
)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_path_cells}{String. Path to the cell-based binary file.}

\item{f_path_genes}{String. Path to the gene-based binary file.}

\item{gs_list}{List. List of integer vectors, where each vector contains
gene indices (0-based) for a module/gene set.}

\item{cells_to_keep}{Integer. Vector of indices of the cells to keep.}

\item{nbin}{Integer. Number of bins for gene stratification.}

\item{ctrl}{Integer. Number of control genes to sample per gene in each
module.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducible control gene sampling.}

\item{streaming}{Logical. If TRUE, processes cells and genes are read in in
chunks to reduce memory usage.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Controls verbosity of the function.}
}
\value{
Matrix of module scores (modules x cells). Each row corresponds to a
module from gs_list, each column to a cell from cells_to_keep.
}
\description{
Calculates module activity scores following Seurat's \code{AddModuleScore}.
For each module (gene set), computes the average expression of genes in the
set minus the average expression of randomly selected control genes from the
same expression bins. Genes are binned based on their average expression
across cells to ensure controls are expression-matched.
