\title{Calculates the TOM over an affinity matrix}
\usage{
rs_tom(x, signed)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numerical matrix. Affinity matrix.}

\item{signed}{Boolean. Shall the signed TOM be calculated. If set to \code{FALSE}, values
should be â‰¥ 0.}
}
\value{
Returns the TOM matrix.
}
\description{
Calculates the topological overlap measure for a given affinity matrix
x. Has the option to calculate the signed and unsigned version.
