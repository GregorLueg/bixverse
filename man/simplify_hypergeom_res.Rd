\title{Simplify gene set results via ontologies}
\usage{
simplify_hypergeom_res(res, parent_child_dt, weights, min_sim = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{data.table. The enrichment results. Needs to have the columns
\code{c("gene_set_name", "fdr")}.}

\item{parent_child_dt}{data.table. The data.table with column parent and
child. You also need to have a type column for the Wang similarity to provide
the weights for the relationships.}

\item{weights}{Named numeric. The relationship of type to weight for this
specific edge. For example \code{c("part_of" = 0.8, "is_a" = 0.6)}.}

\item{min_sim}{Float between 0 and 1. The minimum similarity that the terms
need to have.}
}
\value{
data.table with enrichment results.
}
\description{
This function provides an interface to simplify overenrichment results
based on ontological information of the pathway origin (typical use case
is to simplify gene ontology results). To do so, the function will
calculate the Wang similarity and keep within a set of highly similar terms
the one with the lowest fdr. Should there be terms with the same fdr, the
function will keep the most specific term within the ontology.
