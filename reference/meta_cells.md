# bixverse meta cell class

This is the `bixverse`-based meta cell class. It is generated by running
meta-cell generating functions on top of the main class. Due to the
aggregation of the count matrices to a way smaller number of meta cells,
the data is held in memory for this class specifically. Additional
methods that make specific usage of meta cells (especially co-expression
module detection ones will be made available).

## Usage

``` r
meta_cells(meta_cell_data, var_data, meta_cell_method)
```

## Arguments

- meta_cell_data:

  Named list. Output of meta-cell generation Rust functions. Will
  contain the aggregated raw and normalised counts, plus additional
  information on the origin of the meta cells.

- var_data:

  data.table with the variable/feature informations.

- meta_cell_method:

  String describing the origin of the metacell.

## Value

Returns the `meta_cells` class for further operations.

## Properties

- obs_table:

  The meta cell observation table.

- var_table:

  The meta cell variable table.

- data:

  List with the raw and normalised counts.

- original_assignment:

  List with original assignment information.

- dims:

  Dimensions of the new meta cell matrices.

- other_data:

  Potential other data returned from the meta-cell generating methods.
