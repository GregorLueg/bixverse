# Set similarities

This function calculates the Jaccard or similarity index between a two
given string vector and a of other string vectors.

## Usage

``` r
rs_set_similarity(s_1, s_2, overlap_coefficient)
```

## Arguments

- s_1:

  The String vector against which to calculate the set similarities.

- s_2:

  The String vector against which to calculate the set similarities.

- overlap_coefficient:

  Boolean. Use the overlap coefficient instead of the Jaccard similarity
  be calculated.
